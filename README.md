#### Remote sensing satellite images have not been thoroughly studied in greenness analysis of Bangladesh. The purpose of this study is to create a systemic database for greenness analysis of Dhaka Division of Bangladesh. Here, we developed a web based greenness analysis tool using Remote sensing of MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images. MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetatin Index) is the most popularly used vegetation index in Remote sensing to calculate the amount of greenness.
